### Greetings!

Thank you for visiting my website. The purpose of this blog is to post about cybersecurity topics, especially those related to securing enterprise networks, infrastructure and connected endpoint devices. Commonly referred to as DevSecOps, my objective is to describe everyone's responsibility towards security, explain secure DevOps best practices, program code explanations and to share the knowledge I gain throughout my career as an information security professional.

My objectives include the following:
+ Reteaching concepts learned on the job and from school to reaffirm my understanding of the topics
+ Improving my writing skills by producing clear and concise content, including blog posts, code explanations and enhance my technical writing (for work purposes)
+ Writing all my blog content using markdown syntax
+ Actively using the widely distributed and fairly common text editor known as Vim
+ Maintain my own site, including the front-end design, back-end configurations, and python applications 

I seek to make this site a medium where I can share my passion for techonology, especially information security, programming and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

If you have any questions, comments or seek to collaborate on a project, please send me an email at the following email address:
