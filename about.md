<!--- #### **Reading time:** {{ content | reading_time_as_i }}--->

I grew up near the Chicagoland area and officially moved to Chicago, IL when I started college in 2009. In 2015, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Management Information Systems from DePaul University. A bit of backstory though...a few quarters into the start of my degree, I realized I needed to bridge the gap between finance/accounting professionals and information systems/technology professionals. I figured that if I generally know how accounting and IT stuff work, I could convey business processes to information systems professionals and vice versa. 

After graduating, I landed an internship with a Telecommunications company as an internal audit intern. Fortunately I'm still there constantly challenging myself, except now I'm doing IT Auditing!

A few of my hobbies include the following:
+ Bash shell scripting and python programming 
+ Reading, particularly *[O'Reilly&reg; Publications][oreilly]*, such as data science and security articles 
+ Working on raspberry pis

By the way, I'm also starting a Master's degree in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Infrastructure and Networking...again...at DePaul University.

Cool, right?!
**RIGHT!**

Ok, let's move on!

### What is audit?! What is IT audit?l 
Simply put, internal audit teams play a large role in evaluating business processes, risk management strategies and compliance initiatives in place to reduce or eliminate risks to the company, its computing resources, its employees, and their customers. Internal audit teams provide assurance over the integrity of controls over financial statements. 

In my opinion, I believe IT audit goes, a level deeper into evaluating a company's supporting technologies and IT processes. IT audits help provide assurance over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical business data and underlying information systems, including an organization's cybersecurity posture.

...I guess it's most appropriate that I decided to begin blogging about some of my favorite hobbies at this point in time in my career.

## ABOUT THE BLOG 
The purpose of this blog is to post about cybersecurity topics, especially those related to securing enterprise networks, infrastructure 
and connected endpoint devices. Commonly referred to as DevSecOps, my objective is to describe everyone's responsibility towards security, explain secure DevOps best practices, program code explanations and to share the knowledge I gain throughout my career as an information security professional.

### Why information security?! Why now?! Why me?!
Now, more than ever, have threats manifested themselves in our society. From physical to cyber attacks, our security is and always will be susceptible to breaches. Much like hardware infrastructure being networked, or connected to each other across networks, believe it or not so are we. As users we are networked and therefore prime targets for social engineering attacks. Our active user presence on the internet, gives malicious actors opportunities for identifying vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. Therefore, we as users, need to vigilent and proactively seek out ways to protect ourselves in the physical, cyber and cyber-physical world.
