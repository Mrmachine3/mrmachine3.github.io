##### Greetings!
Thank you for visiting! I hope that through your review of my website, I am able to provide some value to you with the content I share. I'll admit this is my first blog site...***EVER*** and my goals may seem a bit far-fetched to some; however, I'm determined to accomplish them.

My objectives include the following:
+ Reteaching concepts learned on the job and from school to reaffirm my understanding of the topics
+ Improving my writing skills by producing clear and concise content, including blog posts, code explanations and enhance my technical writing (for work purposes)
+ Writing all my blog content using markdown syntax
+ Actively using the widely distributed and fairly common text editor known as Vim
+ Maintain my own site, including the front-end design, back-end configurations, and python applications 

I seek to make this site a medium where I can share my passion for techonology, especially information security, programming and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

If you have any questions, comments or seek to collaborate on a project, please send me an email at the following email address:
