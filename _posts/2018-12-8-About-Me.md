### Greetings!

Thank you for visiting my website. I'll admit this is my first site...***EVER*** and my goals may seem a bit far-fetched to some; however, I'm determined to accomplish them and provide great, relevant content to my readers.

My objectives include:
+ Reteaching IT assurance and cybersecurity concepts that I learn on the job and through my post-graduate studies
+ Improving my writing skills by producing clear, concise content in the form of blog posts, code explanations and ultimately, technical writing deliverables for work purposes
+ Implementing security-aware best practices, specifically those that relate to technical security assessments, programming and Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilized in personal projects

I seek to make this site a medium where I can share my passion for techonology, especially information security, programming and IoT applications.

Furthermore, I plan to achieve these objectives through practical means, specifically through the following:
+ Writing all my blog content using markdown syntax
+ Actively using the widely distributed and fairly common command line text editor known as Vim
+ Developing, testing, and deploying scripts for initiatives that include the following:
  * lightweight server infrastructure task automation
  * network security analytics
  * data science analytics and visualizations
  * Raspberry Pi hardware projects (see my *[Projects page][Projects]* for additional details).

***Disclaimers:***
- *This is my first blog.*
- *I am not perfect, nor is my code...*
- *I am maintaining the code for this blog, i.e. all front-end/back-end development work that renders the site you're visiting today, was partly configured by me, but largely developed by the vast open source developer community on Github.*

If you have any questions, comments or seek to collaborate on a project, please send me an email at the following email address:

### About Me

I grew up near the Chicagoland area and officially moved to Chicago, IL when I started college in 2009. In 2015, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Management Information Systems from DePaul University. A bit of backstory though...a few quarters into the start of my degree, I realized I needed to bridge the gap between finance/accounting professionals and information systems/technology professionals. I figured that if I generally know how accounting and IT stuff work, I could convey business processes to information systems professionals and vice versa. 

After graduating, I landed an internship with a Telecommunications company as an internal audit intern. Fortunately I'm still there constantly challenging myself to learn new things, except now I'm doing IT Auditing!

A few of my hobbies include the following:
+ Watching Marvel movies, especially the first Iron Man movie
+ Bash shell scripting
+ Python scripting
+ Reading, particularly *[O'Reilly&reg; Publications][oreilly]* books on data science and programming
+ Working on my many *[Raspberry Pis][RPi]*

Simply put, I'm a tinkerer! I take my inspiration from Mr. Tony Stark!! 

Do you know about ***J.A.R.V.I.S.***? Well...wouldn't it be awesome to develop an artificially intelligent system that could interfaces with our physical world, much like how J.A.R.V.I.S. aids Tony Stark from within his Iron Man suit.

By the way, I'm also starting a Master's degree in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Infrastructure and Networking...at DePaul University.
***GO BLUE DEMONS!!!*** 

Cool, right?!
**RIGHT!**

Ok, let's move on!

### What is audit?! What is IT audit?! 
Simply put, internal audit teams play a large role in evaluating business processes, risk management strategies and compliance initiatives in place to reduce or eliminate risks to the company, its computing resources, its employees, and their customers. Internal audit teams provide assurance over the integrity of controls over financial statements. 

In my opinion, I believe IT audit goes, a level deeper into evaluating a company's supporting technologies and IT processes. IT audits help provide assurance over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical business data and underlying information systems, including an organization's cybersecurity posture.

...I guess it's most appropriate that I decided to begin blogging about some of my favorite hobbies at this point in my career.

The purpose of this blog is to post about cybersecurity topics, especially those related to securing enterprise networks, server infrastructure 
and connected endpoint devices. My objective is to describe everyone's responsibility towards security, explain secure DevOps best practices, program code explanations and to share the knowledge I gain throughout my career as an information security professional.

### Why information security?! Why now?! Why me?!
Now, more than ever, have threats manifested themselves in our society. From physical to cyber attacks, our security is and always will be susceptible to breaches. Much like hardware infrastructure being networked, or connected to each other across networks, believe it or not so are we. As users we are networked and therefore prime targets for social engineering attacks. Our active user presence on the internet, gives malicious actors opportunities for identifying vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. Therefore, we as users, need to vigilent and proactively seek out ways to protect ourselves in the physical, cyber and cyber-physical world.
